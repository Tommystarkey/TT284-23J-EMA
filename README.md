This project contains wireframes for a fictional website for the Open University Running Club.

It was developed as the final project for the Web Technologies module in the second year of my Bachelor's in Computing and IT at the Open University.

The wireframes are designed with dynamic resizing capabilities to ensure responsiveness across various mobile viewports.
